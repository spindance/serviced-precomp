serviced
========

Serviced is a PaaS runtime. It allows users to create, manage and scale services
in a uniform way. This platform is developed by Zenoss. Changes can be comapred 
against their respective source trees. 


Installation
------------

Given that the compile process is very invloved, this is prebuilt and hosted on 
git for easy access with our deployment platforms.
